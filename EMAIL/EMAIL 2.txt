Subject: Request for Salary Review

Dear [ SANJAY PATEL],

I hope you're doing well. Iâ€™d like to take a moment to discuss my current salary. I have thoroughly enjoyed working at [ RED BERRY ] and am grateful for the opportunities to grow both professionally and personally within the team.

Over the past [2 YEAR ], I have taken on additional responsibilities and have made significant contributions to [ WEB CREAT ]. I believe these accomplishments reflect my commitment to the role and the value I bring to the organization.

Given these factors, I would like to request a review of my current compensation. I believe an adjustment would better reflect my contributions, skill set, and the current market standards for someone in my position.

I am happy to discuss this in more detail and would appreciate any feedback or next steps. Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the success of the team.

Best regards,
[ KRISH BARAD ]
